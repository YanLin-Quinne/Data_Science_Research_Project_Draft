# Data Science Research Project

The repository contains all the code and supporting material produced as a thesis for the MSc Data Science (Durham University, 2022-2023).

The thesis topic was to predict the outcome of THE HUNDRED cricket matches, and various machine learning techniques were tried to produce two specialised models (half-time model and full-time model).
